## Concept

In an effort to help photographers to manage a big quantity of photographies produced in the new digital world we propose here a workflow and a library to help then, [organizing](./workflow.md#project-preparatino), [riching](./workflow.md#sifting), [editing](./workflow.md#edition) and [packing](./workflow.md#packing) images.

A photographer could be considerated here as a single person or a group of photographers working together for the same goal. In [personas](./personas.md) we give names to each role that a photographer could play, just with the intention to well define the steps and its responsibles in the [workflow](./worflow.md). A photographer could play more than one role or work together with others photographers sharing roles.
